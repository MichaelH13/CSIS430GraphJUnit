               I want you to collaborate as a class to collect data
               about our campus. For each building (e.g., EHS, Hoover) or 
               landmark (e.g., baseball field, soccer field, track, 
               tennis courts) on campus I want you
               to collect the following information:
               <dl>
                  <dt>Name, adjacent building/landmark, distance (in feet)
               </dt></dl>
               The result should be a file containing the vertices first, followed by the edges; each
               set should be preceded by the number of vertices/edges that follow. E.g.,
               <pre>               3
               Hoover
               Edwards-Holman Science Center
               Stevens Center
               2
               Hoover, Edwards-Holman Science Center, 35
               Hoover, Stevens Center, 43
               </pre>
               <p>
               The distance can be approximate (e.g., walk it and
               multiply by the length of your average stride).
               The definition of "adjacent" is somewhat arbitrary. 
               We'll define adjacent to mean a place one can reach via a
               developed path without passing sufficiently near to
               another building/landmark. For example, EHS is adjacent
               to Hoover but not to the Steven's Center (STV) since one
               travels to (past) Hoover in route. Where there may be
               more than one route, choose the shortest. 
               </p><p>
               You don't need to include every small house, but should
               include "houses" that house academic or administrative offices.
               </p><p>
               We will not
               concern ourselves with the space occupied by a building
               nor the fact that the routes to/from a building may be to
               different corners that are some distance apart - I'm more
               interested in coverage than in absolute accuracy.
               </p><p>
               As a group, submit <strong>one set of data</strong>; the
               distances should be given as integers (a comma-delimited file would be nice).
