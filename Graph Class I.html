      In this course we'll be working with graphs. So let's
      build a simple templated graph class with some basic graph
      functionality that we can expand upon in later assignments. We'll
      implement a weighted graph that can be directed <b>or</b>
      undirected:
      <p>
      </p><pre class="code">public class Graph&lt;T&gt; {
   public Graph(boolean isDirected) {}
   public List&lt;T&gt; getVertices() {}
   public int getEdgeWeight(T source, T destination) {}
   public boolean edgeExists(T source, T destination) {}
   public void addVertex(T vertex) throws IllegalArgumentException {}
   public void removeVertex(T vertex) throws NoSuchElementException {}
   public void addEdge(T source, T destination, int weight) 
         throws IllegalArgumentException, NoSuchElementException {}
   public void removeEdge(T source, T destination) throws NoSuchElementException {}
   public String toString() {}
}
      </pre>
      <p>
      Notes:
      </p><ul>
         <li>If the graph is undirected then adding an edge between
            <em>V<sub>1</sub></em> and 
            <em>V<sub>2</sub></em> means there is also an edge
            between <em>V<sub>2</sub></em> and 
            <em>V<sub>1</sub></em>. Similarly, removing either edge
            conceptually removes the other.
         </li>
         <li>Some methods should throw appropriate exceptions as shown
            above for reasons that should be obvious. A less obvious
            error is that it's not legal to add an edge between a vertex
            and itself. Otherwise, some methods don't need to throw
            exceptions as their return value is sufficient (e.g.,
            <kbd>null</kbd> or <kbd>-1</kbd>). Overwritting an existing
            edge (i.e., updating weight) is fine as well.
         </li>
         <li><kdb>getEdgeWeight should return
         <kbd>-1</kbd> if no such edge is present as weighted graphs
         often (and in our case) only allow non-negative edge weights.
         In addition, though we won't add edges where source and
         destination are the same, if asked for the weight of such an
         edge we'll respond with 0.
         </kdb></li>
         <li>The class, as shown, says nothing about how the graph is to
            be implementation. You might choose an <em>Adjacency-Matrix</em>
            or <em>Adjacency-List</em> implementation. Yet another alternative 
            are nested <kbd>HashMap</kbd> which is somewhat like an
            <em>Adjacency-List</em> implementation with slightly higher
            space complexity but slightly better time complexity; two
            benefits are that we can use non-numeric values
            for vertices and the underlying data structure
            does most of the work for us when implementing methods.
         </li>
         <li>It may seem odd to have 
            <kbd>getVertices()</kbd> return a sequence instead of a set.
            The reason for that may become clear later; otherwise a set
            would have been quite reasonable.</li>
         <li><kbd>toString()</kbd> is left as an exercise for the
         student; it should return a reasonable human-readable
         representation of the graph.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      This would be a good opportunity to practice <em>test-driven
         development</em> by writing a JUnit test-harness first and then
      implementing your class.
      </p><p>
      Finally, this is relatively simple and straightforward; most
      methods (not including exception-handling) should be <b>very</b>
      short. Do not over-design but understand and fully meet the 
      specifications. If you have questions about the 
      specifications, <b>ask!</b>
